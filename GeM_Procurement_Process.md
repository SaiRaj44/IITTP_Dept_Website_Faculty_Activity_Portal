---

## 🔎 1. Check Product Availability on GeM

1. **Search for the required product/service on the GeM portal.**  
   - Confirm availability *with matching specifications and delivery requirements*.  
2. **Available on GeM → use mandatory GeM procurement routes** (see Section 2 below).  
3. **Not available on GeM → obtain “Non-Availability Certificate (NAC)”**  
   - Generate GeM Availability Report (GeMAR) with unique ID.  
   - Upload report on file as proof of genuine non-availability.

When a product is truly not available on the GeM portal:

   - May require Local Purchase Committee (LPC) evaluation.  
   - Follow internal procedures for quotes, committee checks, and approvals.

## 📊 4. Notes on Scientific & Special Procurement

- Scientific equipment/procurement above usual GeM thresholds (e.g., ₹10 lakh) may have different handling under certain DoE/Ministry guidelines.  
- Often requires technical committee evaluation, specifications review, and reasoned justification for skipping GeM or higher purchase limits.

## 🧩 5. General Compliance Points

✅ Maintain document trail:  
- GeMAR availability report  
- Price comparison sheets  
- Competent authority endorsements  
- Purchase orders & delivery records
